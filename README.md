## UX (User Experience)

The design of this site is pretty simple. There is a sidebar that allows you to navigate through the website. This side bar can be toggled closed to allow for a better viewing experience when needed. The data for the Coronavirus statistics is split into 2 different sections. **Graphs** is used to display statistics in a graphical manner with statistics such as a breakdown of confirmed cases vs gender, hospitalisations, age, etc. **Interactive Map** is a visual representation of Ireland and its counties with a breakdown of the confirmed cases in each county. This data is displayed when hovering over the county.

### Design Choices

#### Fonts
**Statistics font** - I chose a sans-serif font called Segoe UI as this font is very readible at small sizes. This is important when displaying lots of data.
**Body font** - I chose a sans-serif font called Poppins as this is a good font for websites with easy readability at diferent sizes.
**Heading font** - I chose Helvetica as this font pairs well with Segoe UI.

#### Colours
Since this is a dasboard I kept the colours simple so that the data would be easy to read

* Background: #f5f6fa
* Side Bar Background: #212121
* Side Bar Active List Element: #32373d
* Chart Boxes: #fff
* Highlight Colour: #fff

## User stories
Below is a list if the specific user stories for this project.
1. As a user I want to be able to see the latest Coronavirus figures for Ireland.
2. As a user I want to be able to see the latest Coronavirus figures for specific counties in Ireland.
3. As a user I want to be able to see the amount of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries in total and for today.
4. As a user I want to be able to see the breakdown of figures related to gender, age and how the virus is transmitted.
5. As a user I want to be kept up to date with the latest daily figures.

---

## Features

### View Daily Coronavirus Figures
The user has the ability to see the new confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries for that day.

### View Total Coronavirus Figures
The user has the ability to see the total confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries since the virus first occured in Ireland.

### View County Specific Coronavirus Figures
The user has the ability to see the total confirmed cases for each county in Ireland.

### Sign Up For Email Updates
The user has the ability to subscribe for daily email updates to see the total new confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries for that day. Note: these daily email updates will be implemented at a later date, for now the emails are just being collected.

---

## Future Goals
There are many useful updates that could be implemented in this project in the future. 

### Use better datasets
The datasets that were used are very poor quality. A future update would use more accurate and regularly updated datasets

### Newsletter
The newsletter requires a backend so a future update would add a backend to this project which emails all subscribers with a daily update. Alternatively a paid plan with an email marketing platform would also work.

### Worldwide statistic
This project could be expanded to provide worldwide statistics and a worldwide Interactive SVG map.

### News Updates
Another useful feature could be latest news updates from the Irish government, WHO and CDC.

---

## Project Planning

**Stage 1** - Implement the genral layout of the dashboard.

**Stage 2** - Create bar and pie charts using the chart.js library to display sample data. This data will later be replaced with the latest coronavirus figures.

**Stage 3** - Create an interactive SVG map of Ireland, which when a county is hovered over will display sample data. This data will later be replaced with the latest coronavirus figures.

**Stage 4** - Use the data.gov APIs to populate the charts and interactive map with the data from the datasets.

**Stage 5** - Test robustness of the site and optimize performance and code.

## Issues

### Open Issues
The list below displays the current **open** issues with the project:
1. There appears to be an issue with the dataset that is used for the Graphs page as the value for the daily confirmed recoveries is the same as the total confirmed recoveries.

2. To send a daily newsletter I would either need a backend to send the newsletter at a specific time each day or I would have to use a paid plan on an email marketing platform such as Mailchimp.

3. The [dataset](https://opendata-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/d9be85b30d7748b5b7c09450b8aede63_0?geometry=-29.217%2C51.133%2C12.597%2C55.710&page=188) for populating the county data does not contain any data for deaths or recoveries even those these parameters are available.

4. Could not use JQuery on charts.js and interactive_map.js as they the following error was thrown 
```sh
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'
```
From researching it seems like maybe JQuery is not supported by ES6

5. The [dataset](https://opendata-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/d9be85b30d7748b5b7c09450b8aede63_0?geometry=-29.217%2C51.133%2C12.597%2C55.710&page=188) for populating the county data does not contain any data for Northern Ireland.

### Closed Issues

The list below displays the current **closed** issues with the project:
1. Renaming files cause issues with GitHub. Locally, case did not matter but it mattered on GitHub pages so some files were not being referenced properly.

2. The APIs from data.gov did not have an easy way to get the latest days data. For the Graphs data I had to make an API call which sorted the data by Date descending. This allowed me to take the 1st element from the data array to get all the data related to the latest date. For the interactive map I had to make an API call which sorted the data by TimeStamp descending. This allowed me to take the 1st 26 elements from the data array to get all the data related to the latest date for each of the 26 counties of Ireland.

3. The svgMap project did was developed for a map of the globe and each country was an element. I needed to refactor this whole project so that it used a map of Ireland and each county was an element. 

4. The tooltip did not get displayed when using a touch enabled device. This is a bug from the [svgMap](https://github.com/StephanWagner/svgMap) project. I have fixed this issue and also pushed a [fix](https://github.com/StephanWagner/svgMap/pulls) to the repo for the original project.
